			<h1>1st Episode of Psychosis</h1>

				<p>They experienced their first episode of psychosis (FEP) when they were 19 years old. Their parents initially noticed them behaving strangely and at first suspected them of suffering from depression. They became very withdrawn from their friends and family and would often stay in their room for days at a time. They also experienced visual hallucinations. They started worrying that everyone around them was talking about them behind their back and found it hard to ‘organize their thoughts’ when they were studying at school.</p>
